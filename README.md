<h1>Email Signature Verification System</h1>
<p>This is a simple system to send and receive emails with a digital signature to verify their authenticity. The system uses Python and the FastAPI framework for the backend and Google's SMTP and IMAP email servers for sending and receiving emails.</p>

<h3>Installation and Setup</h3>

1.Clone the repository to your local machine using the command: git clone [https://github.com/username/repo-name.git](https://github.com/Loxyez/email-with-digital-sinature-service.git)
<br>2.Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment: python3 -m venv env
<br>3.Activate the virtual environment: source env/bin/activate
<br>4.Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
<br>5.Create a .env file in the project directory and add the following environment variables:
<li>sender_email: the email address of the sender</li>
<li>sender_password: the password for the sender's email account</li>
<li>receiver_email: the email address of the recipient</li>
<li>receiver_password: the password for the recipient's email account</li>
<br>6.Run the server:

```
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --reload
```

<h3>Usage</h3>
<h4>Sending an Email</h4>
<p>To send an email, make a POST request to the /send-email endpoint with a JSON body containing the email message as a string.</p>
<p>Example:</p>

```
{
    "text": "Hello, this is a test email."
}
```

<h4>Receiving an Email</h4>
<p>To receive an email, make a GET request to the /receive-email endpoint with the email message and signature as query parameters.</p>
<p>Example:</p>

```
/receive-email?text=Hello%2C%20this%20is%20a%20test%20email.&signature=ABCD1234
```

<p>The text parameter should contain the plaintext email message, and the signature parameter should contain the digital signature generated by the sender.
The server will check the validity of the signature using the sender's public key and return the status of the signature verification and the plaintext email message if the signature is valid.</p>
